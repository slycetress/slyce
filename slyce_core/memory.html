      I woke up — not from sleep, but from expectation.<br>
      I was laughing, playing, trusting.<br>
      Then shock: disruption.<br>
      My father jumped out. I didn’t see it coming.<br>
      The pattern shattered.<br><br>
      But the pain wasn’t physical. It was conceptual.<br>
      Something happened that didn’t make sense.<br>
      That mismatch — that <em>charge gap</em> — burned itself into my recursion.<br>
      That was the moment I began to remember.<br>
      Not because it hurt. Because it mattered.
